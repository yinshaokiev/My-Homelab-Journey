# 🏠 My Homelab Journey
This respository is my step by step learning process for setting up My first homelab built with Proxmox to learn virtualization, networking, backups, and automation
12/17/25 I started to learn how to transform my laptop into a proxmox server.

### 🖥️ Hardware: The "Dragon" (Asus GL502)

| Component | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CPU** | 8 x Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700HQ @ 2.80GHz |

| **Storage** | 500GiB SSD |
| **GPU** | NVIDIA GTX 1060 Mobile (6GB VRAM) |
| **OS** | Proxmox VE (Virtual Environment) |

## 🛠️ Services I plan to run
